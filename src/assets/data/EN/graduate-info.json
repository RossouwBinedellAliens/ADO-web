Even if you’re not a designer but you’ve finished your studies and have interest in solving wicked problems, we’d love for you to grow your skills with us. \n\nThe year will focus on allowing you to explore different areas of design and business to see what interests you most and where your strengths lie. This is a paid programme that runs over 12 months and will provide you with training, mentorship and tons of fun throughout the year."
